Digital Financial Services Providers (DFSPs) have relationships with consumers, merchants, and other enterprises, and provide digital financial services to End Users.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Interoperability</strong></td><td>The ability of DFSPs participating in a payment Scheme to exchange Transactions with each other. The term may also be used when two systems interconnect.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Account Mapper or Account Lookup Directory Service</strong></td><td>A dynamic directory matching beneficiaries’ unique identifier and their account numbers enable multiple programs to direct payments to the same account and beneficiaries to switch payment service providers.

Based on the principle of unity of cash and the unity of treasury, a TSA is a bank account or a set of linked accounts through which the government transacts all its receipts and payments. The principle of unity follows from the fungibility of all cash irrespective of its end use. While it is necessary to distinguish individual cash transactions for control and reporting purposes, this purpose is achieved through the accounting system and not by holding/depositing cash in transaction-specific bank accounts. <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2010/wp10143.pdf#%3A~%3Atext%3DA%20treasury%20single%20account%20%28TSA%29%20is%20an%20essential%2Cpriority%20in%20the%20public%20financial%20management%20reform%20agenda">This enables the treasury to delink management of cash from control at a transaction level</a>.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)</strong></td><td>A unique sequence of characters that identifies a logical or physical resource used by web technologies.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Voucher</strong></td><td>A token that entitles the holder to a discount or that may be exchanged for goods or services.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Voucher Group</strong></td><td>A voucher group is a characteristic of a voucher that restricts the function or use case that a voucher can be used for.
